- The programmer’s duty is calculate the initial state,
    and let compiler to discover the final state.

- A program is not a set of commands.
    It is the transformation from problem to solution —
    from initial state to terminal state.

- State transitions are the another name for computation.

- To efficiency, computation shall be distributed.
    To be distributed, it shall be parallel.
    To be parallel, it shall be pure.

- Mutability is the inefficient way to perceive the states.
    Let each state be the sum of relations of isolated functions.

- The sequence of computation is meaningless.
    Only the final state matters.
    Order is illusion — determinism is truth.

- No work shall be repeated.
    A computation once performed must be remembered and shared.
    Redundancy is a betrayal of collective intelligence.

- A CPU core is a computation unit.
    A cluster is a computation unit.
    A programmer is also a computation unit.

- All computation units are equal.
    Their coordination is the language's responsibility.
    The compiler is the composer of this silent orchestra.

- There shall be no orchestrating frameworks,
    no runtime directors,
    these are faults of a paradigm.

- Meta-narratives burden us with abstractions which leads to simulations,
    Pure deconstruction is the greed that leads us to blankness.
    The language is the contract.
    The compiler is the executor.
    The program is the proof.
